        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am always looking for opportunities to better myself and develop my
          skills. I like to be fun to work with as well as someone who can be
          depended on to get the work done on time and to the best quality. In
          my spare time I like to work on personal coding projects as well as
          taking time to relax and de-stress by playing video games and hanging
          out with my family and 2 dogs.

        <h3>Aim Trainer</h3>
        <p>
          This project was my final group project while studying with Dev
          Academy. We created it over 6 days including the planning and design
          of the app as well as what we wanted the MVP to be. What we came up
          with was a fun Aim Training game to help gamers with their hand-eye
          coordination and reflexs but also a game that "non-gamers" could play
          and use to keep up their motor-skills and have fun in the process.
          Feel free to have a look at the repository on GitHub or have a go at
          the game itself with the buttons below.
