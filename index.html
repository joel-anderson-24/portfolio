        <hr />
        <p>
          I am always looking for opportunities to better myself and develop my
          skills. I like to be fun to work with as well as someone who can be
          depended on to get the work done on time and to the best quality. In
          my spare time I like to work on personal coding projects as well as
          taking time to relax and de-stress by playing video games and hanging
          out with my family and 2 dogs.

        <h3>Aim Trainer</h3>
        <p>
          This project was my final group project while studying with Dev
          Academy. We created it over 6 days including the planning and design
          of the app as well as what we wanted the MVP to be. What we came up
          with was a fun Aim Training game to help gamers with their hand-eye
          coordination and reflexs but also a game that "non-gamers" could play
          and use to keep up their motor-skills and have fun in the process.
          Feel free to have a look at the repository on GitHub or have a go at
          the game itself with the buttons below.

        <h3>To Do Full-stack</h3>
        <p>
          This was a challenge that was given to me by Dev Academy during my
          study with them. It was a challenge to have us practice creating a
          Full-Stack app with Back-End and Front-End code by using a database,
          database functions, api calls, React, useQuery and useMutation.

        <p>
          This is the first project that I worked on while studying at Dev
          Academy. It is a static HTML website but it showcases a lot of
          information about me, my learning style and my journey through study.
          I am still proud of this because it shows how far I have come since
          then.

      <h2>In The Works</h2>
      <hr />
      <div class="container">
        <p>
          I am currently wokring on a personal project that I have carried over
          from my studies with Dev Academy. It is giving me an opportunity to
          continue developing my skills as I am using React, useQuery,
          useMutation, Auth0, a database, multiple forms and inputs. When I have
          completed this project I will update my projects above so it can be
          viewed by all.
        </p>
        <p>
          After I have completed by personal project (to some degree as there
          will always be room for improvements and updates) I plan to jump into
          C++ to develop my game coding skills as it is something that I have
          always wanted to learn and I am very excited to develop my skills in
          game development as it is something I am very passionate about.
