        <p>
          I am always looking for opportunities to better myself and develop my
          skills. I like to be fun to work with as well as someone who can be
          depended on to get the work done on time and to the best quality. In
          my spare time I like to work on personal coding projects as well as
          taking time to relax and de-stress by playing video games and hanging
          out with my family and 2 dogs.
